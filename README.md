# Recipe App

This web application is built by Python using the Django framework. It's a fully fledged app with an admin panel to perform CRUD operations on the database and letting users sign up and create their own content.

Using this app, users are able to create and modify recipes containing ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty parameter automatically calculated by the application within their registered accounts. Users are also able to search recipes using ingredients.
